# üí∏ Expense Management System - 3-Tier Architecture on AWS

A scalable, secure, and efficient **Expense Management System** designed using a 3-tier architecture, hosted on AWS infrastructure to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

---

## üåü Features
- **3-Tier Architecture**:
  - **Presentation Tier**: A React.js front-end hosted on Amazon S3 with CloudFront for global content delivery.
  - **Application Tier**: Node.js application deployed on EC2 instances with Auto Scaling and Load Balancing.
  - **Database Tier**: Amazon RDS (MySQL) with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

- **Secure & Scalable**:
  - Implemented Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for enhanced security.
  - Integrated Auto Scaling for traffic management and fault tolerance.

- **Monitoring & Insights**:
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics using Amazon CloudWatch.
